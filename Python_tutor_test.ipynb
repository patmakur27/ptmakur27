            "You: what is tuple?\n",
            "\n",
            "Python Tutor Bot: Great question! A tuple is a special type of data structure in Python that allows you to store multiple items in a single variable. You can think of it like a box that holds different things together.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Here’s a simple explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Immutable**: Once you create a tuple, you cannot change its contents. This means you can't add, remove, or modify the items inside it. It's like sealing a box; once it's closed, you can't change what's inside without opening it again.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Ordered**: The items in a tuple have a specific order. This means that if you put something in first, it will always be in that position unless you create a new tuple.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Heterogeneous**: Tuples can hold different types of data. For example, you can have numbers, strings, and even other tuples all in one tuple!\n",
            "\n",
            "### How to Create a Tuple:\n",
            "\n",
            "You create a tuple by placing the items inside parentheses `()` and separating them with commas. Here’s an example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "my_tuple = (1, \"apple\", 3.14)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "In this example:\n",
            "- `1` is an integer,\n",
            "- `\"apple\"` is a string,\n",
            "- `3.14` is a float (a number with decimals).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Accessing Items in a Tuple:\n",
            "\n",
            "You can access the items in a tuple using their index (position), starting from 0. For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "print(my_tuple[0])  # This will print: 1\n",
            "print(my_tuple[1])  # This will print: apple\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Common Mistake:\n",
            "\n",
            "A common mistake beginners make is trying to change an item in a tuple. For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "my_tuple[0] = 2  # This will cause an error!\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "Since tuples are immutable, this line will give you an error saying you can't change the item.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Summary:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Tuples are ordered collections of items.\n",
            "- They are immutable (you can't change them).\n",
            "- They can hold different types of data.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you have any more questions about tuples or anything else in Python, feel free to ask!\n",
            "\n",
            "You: exit\n",
            "Goodbye! Happy coding! 👋\n"
